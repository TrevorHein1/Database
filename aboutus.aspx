    <p> The Iowa City Public Library was established in 2009 and has been a useful resource to the public of Iowa City.

    <p> The Iowa City Public Library has recently implented a new software program to make everyday tasks and operations
        more efficient.  This software is linked to a database where our librarians will be able to efficiently add, update, 
        delete materials on a daily basis.  These database software will also enable us to make our patrons become memebers
        a lot more quickly than the old card system.  We hope you enjoy searching our materials at a much faster pace as
        well as from you own electronic devices.
